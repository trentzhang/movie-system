# Movie System Project

Welcome to the Movie System project! This project is the culmination of our efforts in the CS409 Art of Web Programming class, aimed at creating a comprehensive and efficient movie management system.

## Project Background

In our previous project attempts, we encountered numerous bugs and unfinished features. This project seeks to rectify those issues, providing a polished and functioning movie system for users.

## Key Features

- **CI/CD Development:** We follow Continuous Integration and Continuous Deployment (CI/CD) practices to ensure code quality and deploy updates seamlessly using GitHub Actions.

- **Live Deployment:** You can access the live deployment of our project [here](http://149.248.8.180:3001/home/).

- **Modern JavaScript (ES6):** We adhere to best practices for ES6 JavaScript, ensuring clean and maintainable code.

- **Frontend-Backend Separation:** Our project employs a clear separation between the frontend and backend components, making the codebase modular and easy to manage.

- **Restful API Design:** We have designed and implemented a RESTful API for smooth communication between the frontend and backend.

- **Database:** MySQL serves as our database to store movie information efficiently.

- **User Authentication:** Firebase is used for user authentication, ensuring secure access to the system.

## Project Development

Our project is a work in progress, with continuous development and improvements planned for the future. We are committed to delivering a high-quality movie system that meets your needs.
